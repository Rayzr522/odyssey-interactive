The Strait of Messina (Stretto di Messina in Italian) is the narrow passage between the eastern tip of Sicily (Punta del Faro) and the western tip of Calabria (Punta Pezzo) in the south of Italy. It connects the Tyrrhenian Sea to the north with the Ionian Sea to the south, within the central Mediterranean.

## Characters
Scylla and Charybdis were monsters from Greek mythology thought to inhabit the Strait of Messina, the narrow sea between Sicily and the Italian mainland. Preying on passing mariners, Scylla was a terrible creature with six heads and twelve feet, while Charybdis, living on the opposite side of the straits, was another monster who, over time, was transformed in the imagination of the ancients into a more rational, but no less lethal, whirlpool. Odysseus famously had to negotiate a passage through their deadly clutches in Homer's Odyssey.


### Odysseus
King of Ithaka, main character of *The Odyssey*. He's the main dude in all this, and he would be prominently displayed in the game (possibly a larger figure of him on a boat surrounded by smaller sailors, emphasizing his importance). Very strong and buff guy, super smart.

### Charybdis
A monster who, over time, was transformed in the imagination of the ancients into a more rational, but no less lethal, whirlpool.

It was believed that Charybdis lived under a rock on one side of the strait. Opposite Charybdis, Ancient Greeks believed there was another sea monster, Scylla, which lived inside a rock. Since the passage between the two monsters was very narrow, sailors who tried to avoid one sea monster would unavoidable get into reach of the other. Charybdis swallowed large amounts of water and then belched them out, creating large whirlpools that resulted in the destruction of passing ships. 

### Crew
Men of Odysseus. Probably wore just a simple tunic. (http://absolutewrite.com/forums/showthread.php?126816-Ancient-Greek-Sailors)
They were all destroyed by Zeuz after eating the cows of Helios. However, they were still partially with Odysseus when he was dealing with Scylla and Charybdis.
