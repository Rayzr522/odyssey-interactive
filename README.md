# Odyssey Interactive
> A 2D game that recreates the scene with Scylla and Charybdis from *The Odyssey* in an interactive form

> This is the WIP latest bleeding-edge build that I update every time I push changes for my game. This always has the latest and greatest (or maybe not so great) stuff I'm working on.

For information on how this game *will* look and work (eventually), head over to [the docs](docs/IDEA.md)!
